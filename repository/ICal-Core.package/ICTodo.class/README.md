I am the representation of a VTODO ical's object.

According to RFC 2445,
The purpose of this object is to "provide a grouping of calendar properties that describe a to-do".

Description: A "VTODO" calendar component is a grouping of component
properties and possibly "VALARM" calendar components that represent
an action-item or assignment. For example, it can be used to
represent an item of work assigned to an individual; such as "turn in
travel expense today".

The "VTODO" calendar component cannot be nested within another
calendar component. However, "VTODO" calendar components can be
related to each other or to a "VTODO" or to a "VJOURNAL" calendar
component with the "RELATED-TO" property.
